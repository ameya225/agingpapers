My guide to papers in Aging and [Geroscience](https://www.nia.nih.gov/research/blog/2015/03/geroscience-needs-aging-biology-research)
==============
I was introduced to the concept of aging biology and the possibility of targeting aging and extending healthy lifespan as a graduate student in the lab of [Dr. Nir Barzilai](http://www.einstein.yu.edu/faculty/484/nir-barzilai/) at [Einstein](http://einstein.yu.edu/). The following papers provided me useful insights in aging biology as well as provided me a historical perspective to the field. Although this list may not be comprehensive and excludes several significant publications in the aging field, I hope that this list can benefit a prospective enthusiast/student/researcher of aging biology, obtain a thorough perspective of what the field has achived and what remains to be done by future geroscientists. 

I want to acknowledge (Dr. Jeff Leek's)[http://jtleek.com/] list of (genomics papers)[https://github.com/jtleek/genomicspapers] that inspired me to do the same for the aging field.

I am happy to hear your thoughts and take suggestions for this list. Feel free to contact me via (e-mail)[akulkarn@mail.einstein.yu.edu] or tweet me (@Mr_Genetics)[https://twitter.com/Mr_Genetics]

Introduction to Biological Hallmarks of Aging and Geroscience

* (The Hallmarks of Aging)[http://www.cell.com/cell/pdf/S0092-8674(13)00645-4.pdf] - This is a landmark paper in geroscience, inspired by Hanahan and Weinberg's (Hallmarks of Cancer)[http://www.cell.com/cell/pdf/S0092-8674(11)00127-9.pdf]. It establishes 9 major biological phenomenons divided into primary, antagonistic and integrative hallmarks of aging.

* (Geroscience: Linking Aging to Chronic Disease)[http://www.cell.com/cell/pdf/S0092-8674(14)01366-X.pdf] - This paper introduces the concept of Geroscience and asserts to understand aging as the common mechanism for multiple age-related chronic morbidities.
